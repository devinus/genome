# Devin Torres's Genomic Data

I believe in helping to propel the advancement of science and refuse to fear
the spectre of genetic discrimination. That probably makes me an idiot, and
there's still plenty of time to be proven one in the future, but with the
passage of [GINA][1] it seems like we're already headed in the right direction.

Low-pass whole genome sequencing (0.4x coverage) from [Nebula Genomics][2] is
coming soon!

Hopefully we'll all be uploaded to the Singularity a la [Moravec Transfer][4]
before [*Gattaca*][5] ever becomes a reality.
