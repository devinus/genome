# Devin Torres's Genomic Data

I believe in helping to propel the advancement of science and refuse to fear
the spectre of genetic discrimination. That may make me an idiot, and there's
still plenty of time to be proven one in the future, but with the passage of
[GINA][1] it seems like we're already headed in the right direction.

Hopefully we'll all be uploaded to the Singularity a la [Moravec Transfer][2]
before *Gattaca* ever becomes a reality.
